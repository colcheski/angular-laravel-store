# Angular Laravel Store

## Overview
A demo store app with an angular frontend and laravel backend.

## Project Structure
- `/backend` - Contains the Laravel backend.
- `/frontend` - Contains the Angular frontend.

## Setup Instructions
### Local Development
Run `./startLocal.sh` from the scripts directory to start local backend and front end development servers.

You can also break out the start of backend and frontend separately if you'd rather by going into the backend directory and running `php artisan serve` and the front end directory and running `ng serve`. You may opt for this if you'd rather have the output from each in its own window.

### Backend
Refer to the [backend README](backend/README.md) for setup instructions.

### Frontend
Refer to the [frontend README](frontend/README.md) for setup instructions.
